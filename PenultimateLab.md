### Consent Form

# Informed Consent Form

## Purpose of the Study
You are being asked to participate in a usability test for a high-fidelity prototype that involves interacting with a machine that pumps custom tastes into the mouth. This study has two parts: customizing taste intensity and playing a taste-integrated game similar to Candy Crush.

## What You Will Do in the Study
1. **Experience 1: Customize Taste**
    - You will type the intensity of six basic tastes (sweet, sour, bitter, umami, salty, water) into a user interface.
    - Hit the "START" button to begin taste delivery and "STOP" to stop it.

2. **Experience 2: Playing Crusgkeo, a Candy Crush Clone**
    - The game lasts 30 seconds.
    - Initially, a combination of sour and sweet tastes will be pumped.
    - A wrong swap will pump a bitter taste, and a right swap will pump a sweet taste.
    - At the end of the game, a combination of bitter and sweet tastes will be pumped.

## Risks
The risks associated with this study are minimal and similar to those encountered in daily life. Tastes used are common and FDA approved.

## Confidentiality
Your data will be kept confidential and anonymous. The results will be used for educational purposes only.

## Voluntary Participation
Your participation in this study is entirely voluntary. You are free to withdraw at any time without penalty.
